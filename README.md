Thanks! I’ll analyze the Euclid repository and draft two README files:

1. A project-level README that gives an overview of the entire system architecture, purpose, and components.
2. A dedicated README for the `Euclid-Web` Next.js frontend, including local setup, technologies, CI/CD (GitHub Actions), and deployment (Docker + Kubernetes + DigitalOcean).

I’ll let you know once they’re ready.
